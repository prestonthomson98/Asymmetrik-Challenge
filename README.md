# Asymmetrik-Challenge
I decided to use Jave to create a Graphic User Interface
From the main directory run: java Assymetrik/BusinessCardParser
and A java window should pop up. The application works best when the window covers half the screen.
Input business card information as it appears on the card.  
Press the button labled parse and the Full Name, Email, and Phone Number on the card should appear directly below the parse button. 
# Thank you for this opportunity, I hope to hear from you soon.
